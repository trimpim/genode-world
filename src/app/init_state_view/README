This component analyzes a init state report and porduces an xml configuration
that can be feed in to a menu_view to display the memory and CAP consumation
inside this init.

It is possible to configure if caps should be displayed via the config
attribute monitor_caps.
In addition to the averages it is also possible to display the latest value
via the display_current config attribute.

Configuration
-------------

The following example shows the default values.

! <config monitor_caps="no" display_current="no"/>

The report from init needs at least to report child_ram. For capability monitoring
additionally child_caps are required.

This can be achived by adding the following to the config of init:

! <report init_ram="yes" init_caps="yes" child_ram="yes" child_caps="yes"/>
