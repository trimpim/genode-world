This component edits a single XML file as instructed by clients via
Report sessions. It is designed to allow insertion and removal of XML
nodes without revealing the content the file being edited.

The three edit actions are _add_, _remove_, and toggle, all operate over XML
nodes under the parent node in the file being edited. The content of
edits are verified for corrent syntax and XML node type and _name_
attribute is used to prevent the same node from being inserted
twice and to find nodes to remove or toggle.
